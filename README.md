# BooksWithMusic 📚🎵

**Film-Quality Music Curation for Books**

A modern web-based EPUB reader with **cinematic music curation** that pairs your reading with carefully selected instrumental soundtracks. Like a skilled music supervisor curating a film score, BooksWithMusic analyzes your book's atmosphere, themes, and emotional beats to create a professionally-matched audio experi**5. Professional Selection Algorithm**
- **Exponential Weighting**: 90% chance top-3 tracks, 10% variety from quality pool
- **Quality Threshold**: 20-point minimum for variety picks (no low-quality filler)
- **Anti-Repetition System**: Tracks cooldown for 5 chapters after selection
- **Variety Without Compromise**: Prevents repetition while maintaining quality
- **Transparent Scoring**: Full score breakdown visible in console logs

**6. Page-Level Mood Shifts** (Like Scene Transitions)at enhances every chapter.

## 🎬 The Vision: Film-Quality Music for Literature

Just as a movie's soundtrack is carefully selected to enhance every scene, BooksWithMusic brings that same level of audio craftsmanship to reading:

- **🎭 Intelligent Mood Analysis**: Detects 10 distinct emotional moods and energy levels (1-5)
- **🌍 Cultural Context Detection**: Recognizes 65+ themes including Viking, Celtic, Eastern, Victorian, Noir
- **🎵 Multi-Layer Scoring**: Evaluates tracks on book vibe (88 pts), tag matching (unlimited), energy (5 pts), and tempo (3 pts)
- **🎯 Exponential Weighting**: 90% preference for top-scoring tracks ensures quality, 10% variety prevents repetition
- **📊 Quality Threshold**: Minimum scores prevent low-quality matches from playing
- **🔄 Dynamic Adaptation**: Mood shifts are detected at page-level for seamless transitions

### Why This Matters: The Film Music Analogy

In filmmaking, a music supervisor doesn't randomly select tracks. They:
1. **Understand the Story**: What's the film's overall tone? (Book Vibe Analysis)
2. **Match Each Scene**: What emotion should this scene evoke? (Chapter Mood Analysis)
3. **Consider Energy**: Should this be calm or intense? (Energy Level 1-5)
4. **Maintain Pacing**: How does tempo affect the viewing experience? (Tempo Matching)
5. **Ensure Quality**: Only tracks that truly fit make the cut (Exponential Weighting + Quality Threshold)

**BooksWithMusic applies this exact philosophy to literature.** 

The result? You're not just reading with background music—you're experiencing a **carefully curated cinematic soundtrack** tailored to your book's unique narrative arc, themes, and emotional journey.

### Technical Excellence

Unlike simple "mood playlists," BooksWithMusic:
- ✅ Analyzes **65+ cultural/temporal themes** (not just "happy" or "sad")
- ✅ Uses **multi-dimensional scoring** (5 factors: book vibe, tags, energy, tempo, repetition)
- ✅ Employs **exponential weighting** (90% top tracks) for professional quality
- ✅ Detects **mood intensity levels** (1-5 scale within each mood type)
- ✅ Recognizes **action/conflict levels** (calm vs intense scenes)
- ✅ Identifies **time-of-day atmosphere** (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- ✅ Implements **smart anti-repetition** (5-chapter cooldown for each track)
- ✅ Provides **transparent scoring** so you can see why each track was chosen
- ✅ Maintains **quality thresholds** to avoid poor matches
- ✅ Features **40+ expanded semantic mappings** for cultural/temporal themes

This isn't algorithmic randomness—it's **computational music supervision** using film-industry-inspired methodology. The quality of results depends on your music library (CC0 Freesound or Spotify Premium), but the **selection algorithm itself operates with sophistication comparable to professional music supervision**.

**⚖️ Music Compliance:** All music tracks are CC0-licensed (Creative Commons Zero) from Freesound. Full track usage logging and legal compliance built-in.

## 📋 Terms of Service

### First-Time Login
When you sign in for the first time, you'll be asked to accept the Terms of Use:

1. **Automatic Prompt**: A modal appears before account creation
2. **Must Accept**: You must click "Accept & Continue" to proceed
3. **Stored in Firestore**: Your acceptance is recorded with timestamp
4. **One-Time Only**: Existing users won't see this again (unless terms are updated)

### What You're Agreeing To

**User-Provided Content**: You confirm you own or are legally entitled to upload the ebooks you use.

**Limited License**: You grant the Service permission to store and process your content only for providing the Service to you.

**No Redistribution**: Your content is private and never shared with other users.

**Your Rights**: You remain the owner. The Service doesn't claim ownership of your content.

**Content Removal**: Content can be removed at your request or if there are legal concerns.

**"As Is" Service**: This is an experimental service provided without guarantees.

### Testing the ToS & User Cap

Edit `/js/auth/test-config.js` to toggle test modes:

```javascript
export const TEST_CONFIG = {
  // Show ToS modal to all users (even if already accepted)
  ALWAYS_SHOW_TOS: true,      // true = test ToS, false = normal
  
  // Simulate max users reached (blocks all registrations)
  SIMULATE_MAX_USERS: false,  // true = test user cap, false = normal
  
  // Allow existing users to bypass max users check
  ALLOW_EXISTING_USERS: true
};
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- `ALWAYS_SHOW_TOS: true, SIMULATE_MAX_USERS: false` → Test ToS modal
- `ALWAYS_SHOW_TOS: false, SIMULATE_MAX_USERS: true` → Test user cap message
- Both `false` → Production mode

### For Developers
- Terms acceptance is handled by `/js/auth/terms-of-service.js`
- User acceptance is stored in Firestore `users/{userId}` with fields:
  - `termsAccepted`: boolean
  - `termsVersion`: string (e.g., "1.0")
  - `termsAcceptedAt`: timestamp
- Update `TERMS_VERSION` in the module when terms change to re-prompt users
- ToS check happens BEFORE registration check in the flow

## 🎭 Film-Quality Music Curation System

BooksWithMusic uses a sophisticated multi-layer scoring algorithm inspired by professional film music supervision:

### The Curation Process

**1. Book-Level Analysis (Book Vibe)**
- Analyzes the entire book for dominant themes and atmosphere
- Detects 65+ cultural, temporal, and stylistic themes
- Examples: Viking epics, Victorian mysteries, Eastern adventures, Noir thrillers
- Auto-generates 2-5 "book vibe" keywords that define the overall musical palette
- **Adaptive Weighting System**:
  - **Auto-detected vibe**: 3 points per match (suggests variety, doesn't dominate)
  - **User-overridden vibe**: 8 points per match (respects explicit preference, up to 88 pts)
- This allows auto-detection to guide without restricting variety, while honoring user intent when manually set

**2. Chapter-Level Analysis**
- Detects **10 mood types** with emotional depth:

| Mood | Icon | Music Characteristics | Energy Level |
|------|------|----------------------|--------------|
| Dark | 🌑 | Atmospheric, suspenseful, foreboding | High (4-5) |
| Mysterious | 🔍 | Ethereal, ambient, enigmatic | Medium (3) |
| Romantic | ❤️ | Emotional, piano, tender strings | Low-Medium (2-3) |
| Sad | 😢 | Melancholic, slow, contemplative | Low (1-2) |
| Epic | ⚔️ | Orchestral, cinematic, powerful | High (5) |
| Peaceful | ☮️ | Calm, ambient, serene | Very Low (1) |
| Tense | ⚡ | Suspenseful, urgent, dramatic | High (4-5) |
| Joyful | 😊 | Uplifting, cheerful, bright | Medium-High (3-4) |
| Adventure | 🏝️ | Energetic, cinematic, dynamic | High (4) |
| Magical | ✨ | Fantasy, mystical, ethereal | Medium (3) |

**3. Multi-Layer Scoring (Like Film Music)**
Tracks are evaluated on multiple dimensions:
- **Book Vibe Match (Adaptive)**: 
  - Auto-detected: 3 pts per match (suggests without dominating, ~30 pts typical)
  - User-overridden: 8 pts per match (strong preference, up to 88 pts)
- **Tag Matching**: 5 pts per exact match, 3 pts per partial (ensures mood accuracy)
- **Energy Level**: 5 pts perfect, 3 pts close, 1 pt acceptable (paces the experience)
- **Tempo Match**: 3 pts (complements reading rhythm)
- **Anti-Repetition Penalty**: -30 pts per chapter in cooldown (max -240 for just-played tracks)

**4. Smart Enhancements (NEW)**
- **Mood Intensity Detection** (1-5 scale): Not all "dark" chapters are equally dark—intensity adjusts energy levels dynamically
- **Action/Conflict Level Detection**: Distinguishes between "dark atmosphere" vs "dark action scene" for better energy matching
- **Time-of-Day Awareness**: Morning/afternoon/evening/night scenes get appropriate atmospheric tuning
- **Aggressive Track Memory System**: 8-chapter cooldown with heavy penalties (-240 pts for just-played tracks) forces variety
- **Expanded Semantic Map**: 40+ cultural/temporal/style themes with comprehensive music tag associations
- **Dynamic Energy Adjustment**: Base energy modified by intensity + action level for precision matching

**5. Professional Selection Algorithm**
- **Exponential Weighting**: 90% chance top-3 tracks, 10% variety from quality pool
- **Quality Threshold**: 20-point minimum for variety picks (no low-quality filler)
- **Variety Without Compromise**: Prevents repetition while maintaining quality
- **Transparent Scoring**: Full score breakdown visible in console logs

**5. Page-Level Mood Shifts** (Like Scene Transitions)
- Detects emotional changes within chapters
- Smooth transitions between tracks at mood shift points (Freesound full support, Spotify chapter playlist + shift-aware indexing)
- Maintains narrative flow like a film score

- `📄 Splitting chapter` - Pages created?
- `🎨 renderCurrentPage()` - Content rendered?
- Check `contentLength` and `contentPreview` in logs

### Music Not Playing?
Check console for:
- `🔍 MusicAPI: Searching tracks` - API called?
- `📚 Using fallback demo tracks` - Demo tracks loaded?
- Network tab - Are music URLs loading?
- Try refreshing or checking internet connection

### Common Issues
- **No books showing**: Check IndexedDB in DevTools → Application tab
- **Settings not saving**: Clear localStorage and reload
- **Page turns not working**: Check console for animation errors
