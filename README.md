- **Storage**: Store your EPUB files in the cloud
- **Firestore**: Sync settings and reading progress across devices

### Quick Setup:
1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Google Authentication
3. Set up Firestore Database and Storage
4. Add your Firebase config to `js/config/firebase-config.js`
5. Push to GitHub - your changes go live automatically!

**📖 Full instructions:** See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for complete step-by-step guide.

### Privacy & Security:
- ✅ Your books and settings are **private to your account only**
- ✅ Firebase security rules prevent access to other users' data
- ✅ No server-side code - all operations run in your browser
- ✅ You can delete your data anytime through Firebase Console

## 🎵 Music Setup

### Option 1: Demo Tracks (Default)
The app includes 4 demo tracks that work immediately:
- Peaceful Piano (calm/peaceful moods)
- Epic Adventure (epic/adventure moods)
- Dark Ambient (dark/atmospheric moods)
- Joyful Melody (happy/uplifting moods)

### Option 2: Freesound API (Recommended)
For unlimited music variety:

1. **Sign up** at [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/home/register/)
2. **Apply for API key** at [freesound.org/apiv2/apply](https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/) (instant approval)
3. **In the app**: Settings → Music API → Paste your key → Save
4. Reload the page to use full music library

### Option 3: Your Own Music
1. Place MP3 files in `public/music/` folder
2. Update music URLs in settings or code

## 🧠 AI Mood Detection

The app analyzes chapter text and detects **10 mood types**:

| Mood | Icon | Music Style |
|------|------|-------------|
| Dark | 🌑 | Atmospheric, suspenseful, dramatic |
| Mysterious | 🔍 | Ethereal, ambient, enigmatic |
| Romantic | ❤️ | Emotional, piano, tender |
| Sad | 😢 | Melancholic, slow, emotional |
| Epic | ⚔️ | Orchestral, cinematic, powerful |
| Peaceful | ☮️ | Calm, ambient, serene |
| Tense | ⚡ | Suspenseful, tense, dramatic |
| Joyful | 😊 | Uplifting, cheerful, happy |
| Adventure | 🏝️ | Energetic, cinematic, dynamic |
| Magical | ✨ | Fantasy, mystical, ethereal |

**How it works:**
1. Scans chapter text for mood indicators (keywords, emotional language)
2. Assigns energy level (1-5) and tempo (slow/moderate/upbeat)
3. Maps mood to music tags (e.g., "dark" → "atmospheric", "tense")
4. Selects best-matching tracks from music library
5. Updates music as you navigate between chapters
